# Multiple-Object-Tracking-Under-Noise-and-Occlusion
Employed augmented belief updates and model the positions and uncertainties of occluders and tracked targets using Gaussian distributions, subsequently applying Kalman Filters and Extended Kalman Filters for tracking. For occluders, we use a hand recognition algorithm to distinguish between static and dynamic occlusions (such as hands).
